#  ML Model Comparison Challenge

Welcome to this hands-on challenge from the *Empowering Insight* ML workshop. In this task, you'll build and compare machine learning models for **regression** â€” with a focus on modeling, not data exploration.

---

## Objective

This challenge is designed to help you practice training and evaluating different regression models. We intentionally skip detailed data exploration and visualization so you can gain more practical experience with setting up, fitting, and tuning models.

## Challenge: California House Price Prediction

### Scenario

You are given a dataset containing socio-economic and geographic information about California districts. Your goal is to predict the **median house value** based on features such as income, housing age, and population.

### What to Do

1. Load the California Housing dataset:
   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
   housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
   data = housing.frame
   ```
  
2. **Prepare features and target variable**  
   - Identify the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) from the dataset.

3. **Split the data into training and test sets**  
   - Use `train_test_split` to divide your data (typically 70/30 or 80/20).

4. **Train the following regression models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor

5. **Evaluate each model** using:
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - RÂ² score

6. **Plot regression lines** for a single feature (e.g., `MedInc`) to compare how each model fits the data visually.

## Key Focus

Compare how **regularized**, **tree-based**, and **ensemble models** perform against **basic linear regression** in terms of predictive accuracy and model complexity.

## Final Note

Try to complete the challenge independently.  
I have provided a **solution notebook** so you can:
- Review best practices
- Compare results
- Reflect on your modeling decisions

This exercise is great preparation for your **Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)**, where you'll apply similar tools on your own dataset.

Happy modeling! ðŸš€
