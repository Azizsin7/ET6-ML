# Empowering Insight: Mastering Data Analysis & Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to our ML workshop! This series is designed to give you **hands-on experience** with data analysis and machine learning using Python. You'll explore real datasets, write code in live sessions, and build models that reflect real-world problems.

---

## Workshop Format

Each session is structured for both learning and doing:

- **Lecture**: 20â€“30 minutes  
- **Break**: 10 minutes (in the middle)  
- **Live Coding**: Remainder of the session  

> **Everyone is expected to actively participate** during the coding part!

---

## Tools & Setup

Weâ€™ll be using **Google Colab** for live coding â€” no installation required!

ðŸ”— You just need a **Google account** to access Colab notebooks.  
If you're offline or prefer local development, **Jupyter Notebook** works too.

### If using Jupyter locally, install:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Not Familiar with Notebooks?
