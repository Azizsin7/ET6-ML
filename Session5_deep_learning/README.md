## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Understand the **basic principles** behind deep learning and neural networks.
- Train a **deep neural network (DNN)** using **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**.
- Build and evaluate **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for image-based data.
- Apply **transfer learning** to improve model performance on small datasets using pre-trained networks.

## 🧠 Getting Started with Deep Learning

You **do NOT need Microsoft Azure** or a special setup to complete this module.  
This workshop is designed for **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** environments.

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

#### ✅ If you're using **Google Colab**:
- Just click on the Colab link for each week's notebook.
- Colab runs in the browser—no installation required.
- GPU support is available via `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator`.

#### 💻 If you're using **Jupyter Notebook** locally:
Make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install torch tensorflow 
```

## 📝 Note

This is a hands-on, participatory session.  
✅ Please join with your laptop ready and Colab notebooks open.  
🛠️ If you're using Jupyter Notebook offline, install the required libraries in advance.  

💬 For help, consult your teaching assistants or use breakout rooms during the session for debugging and installation issues.
