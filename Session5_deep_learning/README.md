# Empowering Insight: Deep Learning Models with Python

Welcome to the fifth and final session of the **Empowering Insight: Mastering Data Analysis & Machine Learning with Python** workshop. This module introduces participants to **deep learning**, an advanced form of machine learning inspired by the human brain’s neural structure.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Understand the **basic principles** behind deep learning and neural networks.
- Learn the fundumental of Pythorch and TensorFlow 
- Train a **deep neural network (DNN)** using **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**.
- Apply **transfer learning** to improve model performance on small datasets using pre-trained networks.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this session, you should have:

- Familiarity with basic mathematical concepts (algebra, functions)
- A strong grasp of classical machine learning methods (e.g., regression, classification)
- Experience writing Python code in Jupyter or Colab environments

If you’re using Jupyter Notebook locally, ensure you have installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib torch torchvision tensorflow
```

## Getting Started with Deep Learning

### Setup Instructions

#### If you're using **Google Colab**:
- Just click on the Colab link for each week's notebook.
- Colab runs in the browser—no installation required.
- GPU support is available via `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator`.

#### If you're using **Jupyter Notebook** locally:
Make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install torch tensorflow 
```

## Looking Ahead

Deep learning is a powerful tool—but it's just one part of the machine learning workflow.  
Be sure to combine it with **good data preparation, cleaning, and feature analysis** for the best results!
