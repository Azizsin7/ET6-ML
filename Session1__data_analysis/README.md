# Empowering Insight: Data Analysis & Machine Learning with Python  
### Week 1 – Explore and Analyze Data with Python

---

## 👋 Welcome!

In today’s world, data is everywhere. This workshop is your **first real step into the field of data science**.

> This is not just another coding class — it's a hands-on path toward solving real problems with real data.

---

## Workshop Overview

This 5-week workshop is designed to give you:
- Practical skills in Python-based data analysis and machine learning
- Confidence to work with real-world datasets
- Support for projects, internships, or jobs that involve data

### Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Topic |
|------|-------|

## Why This Workshop Matters

This workshop is part of the **Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)** — your opportunity to:
- Collect or use real datasets
- Select the **machine learning model that fits your problem**
- Build skills that are **directly applicable** to your career or ELO path

> If you don’t want to apply ML, no problem — you’ll still learn to **explore, clean, and visualize data**, which is essential in every data science workflow.

Whether you’re on the **Invidia path**, an **internship path**, or aiming to **start working soon**, this is your golden chance to build skills and a portfolio.

## About This Session (Week 1)

### Session Goal:
Learn how to **explore and analyze data** using Python:

- Load and inspect real-world datasets
- Clean and wrangle missing data
- Use summary statistics to understand patterns
- Visualize key relationships in your data

We’ll follow the official Microsoft Learn module:  

---

##  Tools We'll Use Today

- Python 3
- Google Colab
- `pandas` and `numpy`(data wrangling)
- `matplotlib` (visualization)

You’ll write real code and work alongside the instructor live in Google Colab.

## What Makes This Workshop Different

- ❌ No exams  
- ❌ No graded homework  
- ✅ Real tools  
- ✅ Real skills  
- ✅ Real datasets (as an individual assigment)

But: **You’ll only learn if you show up and engage.**

The more you practice, the more you’ll grow.

## Looking Ahead

By the end of this workshop, you will have:
- Explored and cleaned real data
- Built a few small machine learning models
- Gained confidence to apply ML or visualization to your own project

> 💬 “The best way to learn data science is to *do* data science.”

This is your chance to try, experiment, fail, learn — and grow.
