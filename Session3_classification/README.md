# Session 3 â€“ Introduction to Classification Models

Welcome to **Session 3** of the *Empowering Insight* workshop series! In this session, we focus on **classification**â€”a key machine learning technique used to place items into categories rather than predicting continuous values.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand when to use classification over regression  
- Learn how to train and evaluate classification models using Scikitâ€‘Learn  
- Explore **binary classification** using logistic regression  
- Learn about **multiclass classification** strategies  
- Interpret evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC

---

## Prerequisites

To follow along smoothly, you should have:

- A basic understanding of mathematics  
- Experience programming in Python  
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
