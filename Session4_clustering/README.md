# Train and Evaluate Clustering Models

This project explores **unsupervised learning** using clustering algorithms with `scikit-learn`. You'll learn how to group similar data points into clusters and evaluate the quality of those clusters using common metrics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand when to apply clustering in machine learning
- Train basic and advanced clustering models using Python and `scikit-learn`
- Evaluate clustering models using appropriate metrics and visualization tools

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this module, you should be comfortable with:

- Basic mathematical concepts (distance metrics, distributions)
- Python programming (lists, functions, NumPy, pandas)
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab
