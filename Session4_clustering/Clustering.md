# Session 4: Clustering - Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

**Clustering** is the process of grouping similar objects together. For example, in the image below, 2D data points are clustered into three categories:
- Top-left (yellow)
- Bottom (red)
- Top-right (blue)

Unlike **classification**, clustering is an **unsupervised** learning method â€” this means we don't use labeled data. The model finds patterns and groups data points that share similar characteristics.

Clustering is widely used in:
- Data exploration
- Social network analysis
- Brain connectivity mapping
- Spam filtering
- Market segmentation

## What is Clustering?

Clustering is a form of **unsupervised machine learning** where observations are grouped based on **similarities in their feature values**. Since there are no labels, the model assigns each data point to a **cluster** based purely on its features.

### Example:
A botanist records features of various flowers â€” such as **number of petals** and **number of leaves**.

</p>

Even without predefined categories, clustering can group flowers with similar characteristics. For example:
- Flowers with many leaves and petals
- Flowers with few leaves and many petals
- Others based on combinations of traits

As datasets grow larger (thousands of examples or multiple features), clustering algorithms become essential for identifying hidden structures or patterns.

## Key Concepts
- **Unsupervised learning**: No labels provided
- **Feature similarity**: The basis for grouping
- **Dynamic grouping**: Results depend on algorithm and dataset

Stay curious and experiment with the data! Clustering is where youâ€™ll start to uncover hidden relationships that are not always obvious in structured labels. ðŸš€
